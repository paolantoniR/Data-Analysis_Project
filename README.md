# Data-Analysis_Project

This repository contains two data analysis projects, performed in R, completed as part of my bachelor's studies. The first project focuses on regression analysis, where I explore relationships between house characteristics in different Brazilian cities and how those affect the rent with the scope to build predictive models.
The second project involves classification techniques, where I apply machine learning algorithms to predict wine quality based on various wine characteristics in order to classify the latter into two classes. Both projects include data preprocessing and visualization, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

Inside the repository there are two foders, **Regression** and **classification**, both of which contain: 
+ data (.csv file)
+ R markdown, containing both the code
+ A *.pdf* file containing the report with plots, insights and interpretation of the output
